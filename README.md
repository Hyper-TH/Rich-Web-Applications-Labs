## Explain what is meant by the stream abstraction. What is the relationship between streams and the observer pattern? What are streams useful for modeling and when might you use them in Rich Web development?

## Assume that you are building an interface to an API in your Rich Web App. Describe in detail how you could use the RxJs library to handle asynchronous network responses to API requests. In your opinion, what are the benefits to using a streams library for networking over, say, promises? And what do you think are the downsides?

## Consider three asynchronous tasks, A, B, & C. What are the consequences of these functiosn sharing global state? What is a good practice to alleviate any problems associated with this?
