# Problem 3

By using the files provde for the Chrome Extension, make some changes on the `Content.js` and extend the funcitonality by changing different elements of the DOM.

## Arrays

There are 2 arrays in the file, `hacksImages` contains URLS of randomly picked images where it would contain "deceptive" hacked and/or virus warnings. Additionally, URLs of cat images were also added. The array `sponsors` contain a list of brand names commonly being advertised/sponsored in the YouTube platform.

## Elements

This section of the code is for educational purposes for understanding nested `div`s. This change would only work on [met.ie](https://www.met.ie).
